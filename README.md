elm-comidi
===========

This is a parser for MIDI files written in pure elm and using the [elm-combine](https://github.com/Bogdanp/elm-combine) parser combinator library.

It is a component of an intended eventual assemblage of modules that will allow me to replace [MIDI.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/) in my [tradtunestore](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/tradtunestore) web application. This is used to play MIDI files that have been automatically generated from tunes in [abc notation](http://www.lesession.co.uk/abc/abc_notation.htm) and that have been submitted by users. Other modules will include a soundfont loader and a web-audio player.  

Hopefully, this version is a fully conformant parser which is happy with Type-0, Type-1 and Type-2 files.

Limitations
-----------

Type-2 has not yet been tested.

Running Status messages are supported and placed in the parse tree as such, but perhaps would be better translated into the appropriate channel voice message rather than being left to a later interpreter.
